# diploma_finalyear_project
this repository consisit of files the are used to build the diploma final year project 

after a long planning with having a mindset to do a project the provide a solution for a real world problem and to finish it as cheap as possible, i started this project on march 3rd on woki online simulator with using arduino uso.
and on march 5th march i tried to convert this project with arduino mega which make work smooth but made it quite expensive so initialy i used 8 echo sensors but one the final module the system will runs with only 4 sensor and a switched it back to uno
